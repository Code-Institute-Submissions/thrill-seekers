## Code Validation
The code for the Thrill theekers website was validated using common tools to ensure that it complies with current development standards and conventions. This testing contributes to the reliable functioning of the project.

### HTML Validation
The validation of the HTML code was done with the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). <br>
The html code passed the validation with usw of filter which remove issues related to the React.The settings can be seen in the screenshot.

### JSX Validation
The validation of the JSX code was done with the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) <br>
To check the code with ESLint, "npx eslint" was executed in the terminal. As expected, there is no fedback from the tool. This means that the code does not contain any errors and meets the requirements of eslint.

| Contrast error, due to too little contrast between test and background was displayed on the searchbar | I have made the label invisible so that it can still be used for screanreader. Unfortunately, the error for the contrast still appears in the wave tool. But I don't want to have a visible lable for the searchbar for styling reasons. In my opinion, the searchbar is easily recognisable even without a lable.

## Performance
### Google Lighthouse 
The performance of the Thrill Theekers website was tested using Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools. This tool provides a comprehensive assessment of performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO parameters. The tests were carried out for both desktop and mobile devices. The Parkpage and the Parkspage (homepage) were tested. I suspect that these have the greatest load as there are many images. 

|                | Pages     | Performance | \*Accessibility | \*\*Best Practice | SEO | Screenshot                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Mobile device  | parkspage | 43          | 100             | 79                | 100 | <details><summary>parkspage mobile </summary><img src="./documentationfiles/testing/performance/performance1-mobil.png"></details>    |
|                | parkpage  | 24          | 100             | 79                | 100 | <details><summary>parkspage mobile</summary><img src="./documentationfiles/testing/performance/performance2-mobil.png"></details>     |

The results for Accessibility Best Practice and SEO are good. For Accessibility and SEO even 100 per cent could be achieved. However, the performance values are unfortunately not good at all. The desktop test of both pages is over 50 per cent. Which I think is ok. But the mobile score for the mobile check for the park page was just 24 per cent. For this reason, attempts have been made to improve this. Unfortunately with little success. 
- Lazy loading has been set up using React.lazy. This means that resources are only loaded when required, i.e. the images. 
- In addition, django-resized was used to format and resize the images during upload. This should improve the loading time of the website.
- Another attempt was to reduce the loading time by reducing the data loaded from external resources. The size of the googlefont was reduced so that only latin characters are loaded and no characters used in other languages. Unfortunately, this has led only to a small improvement. 

### Devices and Browser Compability
Using the Chrome dev tool, the website was tested on the available devices via the Google Chrome Developer Tools Device Toggeling option. At the same time, the browser window was reduced to see if the page is responsive. 
The website was also opened in the Firefox browser. <br>
No errors could be detected.

## Manual testing
### User Story testing

All userstoys for the frontend have been tested to ensure that they are fulfilled and that the corresponding functions work as expected.

Then I click on delete and confirm this in the next menu. I check whether data has been saved in the database. Afterwards I will get this again with a new message and click on confirm data. now data should be visible in the database in the backend for a superuser. | When I click on edit, I can edit the sent data and save it again. If the data is not valid, this is displayed. If I click on delete, confirm delete from appears. If I confirm with delete, the data is deleted and I am taken to the homepage. If I click on confirm data, I am also redirected to the homepage and I get a confirmation that the data has been saved. Now I can no longer access it. Only data in the database is visible to the superuser if the data has not been deleted via the menu. | <details><summary>contact_form3</summary><img src="./documentationfiles/testing/userstory/contact_form3.png"></details>     | Pass   |
